Biobanks play a pivotal role in this endeavor by collecting, processing, trans-\nporting, and storing biospecimens, thereby serving as invaluable resources for medical research. In this review, we explore \ncurrently available biobanks, with a specific focus on those dedicated to rare rheumatic diseases. We also examine accessible \nbest practice guidelines for establishing and maintaining high-quality biobanks, discuss the limitations and propose future \ndirections for enhancing biobanking efforts in rare disease research.\nRecent Findings Advances in molecular and genomic technologies have expanded the role of biobanks, enhancing biomarker \ndiscovery and precision medicine. However, despite growth in biobanking capabilities, key challenges persist concerning \nethics, interoperability, and biospecimen exchange, prompting active responses by various regulatory and governing bodies.\nSummary Biobanking has transformed rare disease research. Strengthening national and international collaborations is essen-\ntial for driving progress in this field and accelerating the development of novel therapeutic and precision medicine approaches.\n",

community as per The European Commis-\nsion or fewer than 200,000 people in the United States according \nto the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) [1]. Sev-\neral systemic connective tissue diseases in rheumatology, includ-\ning idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), systemic lupus \nerythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis meet these criteria \n[2]. Investigating these conditions is particularly challenging due \nto their low prevalence and clinical heterogeneity.\nA major obstacle in studying rare diseases is assembling \nsufficiently large and diverse patient cohorts, given the scarcity \nof specialized research centers. While meaningful scientific dis-\ncoveries have been made within single institutions, multi-center \ncollaboration enhances the robustness and generalizability of \nfindings. One of the most significant hurdles in translational \nresearch on rare diseases is limited access to infrastructure sup-\nporting biospecimen collection, storage and analysis.\nBiobanks play a crucial role in overcoming these chal-\nlenges. By providing centralized, facilitating access across \nsites, biobanks enable broader collaboration and improve sta-\ntistical power. This broader access can lead to a more com-\nprehensive understanding of rare systemic rheumatic diseases \nwhich increases the likelihood of identifying novel biomarkers \nthat are accurate and representative of the wider patient popu-\nlations, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment [3].\nHowever, despite their importance, biobanks dedicated to \nrare systemic rheumatic diseases remain limited, with most \nconcentrated in developed countries and major urban centers. \nThis geographical clustering restricts the diversity of patient \npopulations, potentially limiting the representativeness of dis-\nease characteristics in global research. Moreover, there is a \nlack of evidence-based, standardized, and widely accessible \nprotocols for handling biospecimens in rare systemic rheu-\nmatic disease research, further complicating progress in the \nfield.

Additionally, \nmany biobanks operate in isolation, leading to fragmenta-\ntion, reduplication of efforts and limited data sharing.\nTo better understand and address these challenges, \nShickle et\u00a0al. classified biobank networks into six opera-\ntional categories\u2014\u2018storage\u2019, \u2018bring-and-share\u2019, \u2018catalogue\u2019, \n\u2018partnership\u2019, \u2018contribution\u2019, and \u2018expertise\u2019\u2014based on \ntheir operational and governance structures rather than their \nresearch focus. For example, storage networks primarily \noffer centralized infrastructure, developed to provide cost-\neffective shared storage solutions, while expertise networks \nfocus on knowledge-sharing and standardization rather than \nsample exchange. This non-mutually exclusive, governance- \nand operational-focused classification provides a framework \nfor improving biobanking networking and identifying solu-\ntions from an operational perspective [10, 11].\nCross-departmental collaboration, such as partnerships \nwith pathology or clinical biochemistry laboratories, has \nbeen shown to improve sample collection accuracy and \noverall biobank quality, as exemplified by the Danish Rheu-\nmatologic Biobanks [12]. However, variability in sample \nprocessing and the absence of harmonized protocols across \ndifferent biobanks remain major concerns. Differences in \ncollection, handling and storage can introduce confounding \nfactors, potentially compromising the validity of findings \ndue to uncontrolled preanalytical variables. Additionally, \naccurate and standardized clinical data is also vital for link-\ning molecular profiles to disease outcomes [13, 14].\nTo mitigate these challenges, international efforts have \nfocused on establishing standards for sample collection, stor-\nage, and distribution. The International Society for Biological \nand Environmental Repositories (ISBER) provides compre-\nhensive guidance through its Best Practices for Repositories, \nemphasizing risk and quality management, ethical and social \nconsiderations, and uniform specimen handling [15].\nSimilarly, the International Standards Organization (ISO) \nhas developed ISO 20387:2018, an international standard \nspecifically for biobanking. This certification sets glob-\nally recognized quality and competency requirements for \nbiorepositories, covering sample collection, preparation, \ndata management, storage, and distribution [16]. Institu-\ntions adhering to this standard demonstrate high-quality \nbiobanking practices, fostering international collaboration \nand improving research reproducibility. These efforts by \nISBER and ISO have been instrumental in synchronizing \nbiobanking practices globally.\nThe field of oncology also provides a successful model \nfor standardization, with The National Cancer Institute Best \nPractices for Biospecimen Resources serving as a bench-\nmark for consistent biospecimen handling [17].\n", "bbox": {"x0": 306.1435852050781, "y0": 54.14585494995117, "x1": 546.9302368164062, "y1": 719.23583984375}}], [{"id": 0, "type": 0, "text": " \nCurr Rheumatol Rep           (2025) 27:24 \n   24  \nPage 4 of 19\n", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 31.765121459960938, "x1": 511.62139892578125, "y1": 41.33612060546875}}, {"id": 1, "type": 0, "text": "Establishing and\u00a0Maintaining \nDisease\u2011Specific Biobanks in\u00a0Rheumatology: \nLogistical Considerations\n", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 53.97581100463867, "x1": 289.4239807128906, "y1": 93.85186767578125}}, {"id": 2, "type": 0, "text": "Biospecimen Collection and\u00a0Handling\n", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 106.00981140136719, "x1": 221.67648315429688, "y1": 118.59381103515625}}, {"id": 3, "type": 0, "text": "The collection and storage of biospecimens for biobank-\ning has historically lacked standardized practices, par-\nticularly in the pre-analytical steps [18].

How-\never, heterogeneous practices and lack of guidelines on how \nbioresources should be acknowledged in scientific publica-\ntions have led to inconsistencies in reporting. To address \nthis, the Bioresource Research Impact Factor/Framework \n(BRIF) was introduced over a decade ago as an initiative to \nstandardize the recognition of bioresources in research, and \nis currently under further development [45]. The CoBRA \n(Citing Bioresources in Research Articles) guideline was \ndeveloped to standardize the citation of bioresources in sci-\nentific articles, recommending that each bioresource used \nin a study be cited in the methods section and listed as an \nindividual reference [46]. Tools like CoBRA and The Open \nJournal of Bioresources enhance the traceability and vis-\nibility of bioresource use, encouraging transparency, rec-\nognition, and sharing within the research community [47].\n", "bbox": {"x0": 306.1416931152344, "y0": 204.14585876464844, "x1": 546.8739624023438, "y1": 419.23583984375}}, {"id": 4, "type": 0, "text": "Interoperability and\u00a0Biospecimen Exchange\n", "bbox": {"x0": 306.1416931152344, "y0": 440.0078125, "x1": 538.663330078125, "y1": 454.8758239746094}}, {"id": 5, "type": 0, "text": "The premise of the Open Science movement is that shar-\ning data, methods and knowledge accelerates progress, a \nprinciple especially valued in the rare disease communities \n[48].

This approach would dismantle proprietary data \nsilos, meet stakeholder needs, and de-risk early-stage trials, \nthereby incentivizing industry investment in rare disease \nresearch [104].\nAcademic institutions should reconsider promotion and \nrecognition criteria by shifting away from rewarding data \nownership and instead recognizing data-sharing practices \nand collective achievements.
