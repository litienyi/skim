Setting \u2014Pediatric emergency unit of an urban teaching hospital. Subjects \u2014200 infants < 2 months, with symptom(s) of any acute illness. Methods \u2014Respiratory rate (by observa- tion method), and oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) by means of a pulse oximeter were recorded at admission. Infants were cate- gorised by presence or absence of hypoxia (SaO 2  <  90%). Results \u2014The respiratory rate was  >  50/ min in 120 (60%),  >  60/min in 101 (50.5%), and  >  70/min in 58 (29%) infants. Hypoxia (SaO 2  <  90%) was seen in 77 (38.5%) infants.

The situation is quite di V erent in many parts of the developing world where rural health care workers take responsi- bility for much acute illness in childhood, rely- ing on simple clinical observations without access to radiography, oximetry or the luxury of a functioning telephone with which to contact a more senior colleague. In these circum- stances, simple algorithms are required. With minor quali\ufb01cations, in the absence of respira- tory symptoms, fever becomes malaria and in the presence of respiratory symptoms, tachyp- noea becomes pneumonia. These two papers address a topic with a long and controversial history: the signi\ufb01cance of tachypnoea. This is a beguilingly simple physi- cal sign but, as both papers point out, to obtain a reliable estimate of respiratory rate, a carefully standardised procedure should be fol- lowed. Although one may criticise certain aspects of the methodology of both studies, their conclusions that tachypnoea in the \ufb01rst 2 months of life is under some circumstances a surrogate for hypoxaemia and that tachypnoea is a moderately speci\ufb01c and sensitive sign of pneumonia, are both important. But how should these imprecise associations be trans- lated into practical guidelines for action? The WHO management guidelines for acute respi- ratory infections in children use tachypnoea as a critical guide to management. These two studies might usefully contribute to minor revisions to some of its recommendations. For instance, the observations by Palafox and colleagues that tachypnoea was not a reli- able feature of \u201cpneumonia\u201d (that is, radiologi- cal changes in a child with respiratory symp- toms) when symptoms had been present for less than 3 days, would be a useful cautionary message to those who might feel that the absence of tachypnoea inevitably meant the absence of pneumonia. Others, including Singhi  et al , 1   have pointed out that clinical fea- tures other than tachypnoea, such as \u201cdi Y cult breathing\u201d or indrawing reported by the child\u2019s mother, may be equally useful.
