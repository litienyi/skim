Collaborative translational research using biospecimens is essential for advancing our understanding of the diverse charac- teristics and pathophysiology of rare diseases. Biobanks play a pivotal role in this endeavor by collecting, processing, trans- porting, and storing biospecimens, thereby serving as invaluable resources for medical research. In this review, we explore  currently available biobanks, with a specific focus on those dedicated to rare rheumatic diseases. We also examine accessible  best practice guidelines for establishing and maintaining high-quality biobanks, discuss the limitations and propose future  directions for enhancing biobanking efforts in rare disease research. Recent Findings  Advances in molecular and genomic technologies have expanded the role of biobanks, enhancing biomarker  discovery and precision medicine. However, despite growth in biobanking capabilities, key challenges persist concerning  ethics, interoperability, and biospecimen exchange, prompting active responses by various regulatory and governing bodies. Summary  Biobanking has transformed rare disease research.

community as per The European Commis- sion or fewer than 200,000 people in the United States according  to the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) [ 1 ]. Sev- eral systemic connective tissue diseases in rheumatology, includ- ing idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM), systemic lupus  erythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis meet these criteria  [ 2 ]. Investigating these conditions is particularly challenging due  to their low prevalence and clinical heterogeneity. A major obstacle in studying rare diseases is assembling  sufficiently large and diverse patient cohorts, given the scarcity  of specialized research centers. While meaningful scientific dis- coveries have been made within single institutions, multi-center  collaboration enhances the robustness and generalizability of  findings. One of the most significant hurdles in translational  research on rare diseases is limited access to infrastructure sup- porting biospecimen collection, storage and analysis. Biobanks play a crucial role in overcoming these chal- lenges. By providing centralized, facilitating access across  sites, biobanks enable broader collaboration and improve sta- tistical power. This broader access can lead to a more com- prehensive understanding of rare systemic rheumatic diseases  which increases the likelihood of identifying novel biomarkers  that are accurate and representative of the wider patient popu- lations, aiding in early diagnosis and treatment [ 3 ]. However, despite their importance, biobanks dedicated to  rare systemic rheumatic diseases remain limited, with most  concentrated in developed countries and major urban centers.  This geographical clustering restricts the diversity of patient  populations, potentially limiting the representativeness of dis- ease characteristics in global research. Moreover, there is a  lack of evidence-based, standardized, and widely accessible  protocols for handling biospecimens in rare systemic rheu- matic disease research, further complicating progress in the  field. These challenges are particularly pronounced for early- career researchers, especially those at smaller and emerging  and lower -income countries, who may face substantial bar- riers in accessing the infrastructure and resources needed for  biobanking and biospecimen research.

These repositories inte- grate biological samples with clinical data, enabling large- scale studies and providing insights into population health  and disease mechanisms. Biobanks can be broadly catego- rized into population-based and disease-oriented resources,  each serving distinct research needs [ 5 ]. Population-based biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, tend  to operate on a large scale, collecting biological samples  from volunteers, often without specific inclusion or exclu- sion criteria. These biobanks enable large-scale genetic stud- ies and development of risk assessment models [ 6 ]. Another  notable example is the Swedish Malmo Diet Cancer Study,  which has followed 30,000 participants for over 30 years,  enabling important discoveries regarding risk factors for a  variety of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease  and rheumatic conditions like giant cell arteritis and rheu- matoid arthritis [ 7 ]. Similarly, the China Kadoorie Biobank,  with over 500,000 participants, provides regionally anchored,  longitudinal data that has supported investigations into auto- immune disease risk factors in East Asian population [ 8 ]. The  primary aim of population-based biobanks is to investigate the  interplay between genetic susceptibility and environmental  exposures in disease development, combining biospecimen  research with comprehensive clinical and demographic data. Disease-oriented biobanks, in contrast, focus on specific  conditions and enable investigations into pathogenesis, bio- marker discovery, diagnostics, long-term patient monitor- ing and identification of potential therapeutic strategies.  These biobanks provide high-quality biospecimens linked to  detailed clinical information. By integrating a wide array of  data from numerous biological samples, research groups can  develop large-scale research projects and gather information  on the studied population. A key example is the Systemic  Lupus Erythematosus International Collaborating Clin- ics (SLICC), an international repository collecting DNA,  plasma, and serum samples on SLE [ 9 ].", "bbox": {"x0": 51.023590087890625, "y0": 166.64585876464844, "x1": 291.82568359375, "y1": 631.73583984375}}, {"id": "3-5", "text": "Operational Challenges in\u00a0Biobanking", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 652.5078735351562, "x1": 253.7371826171875, "y1": 667.3758544921875}}, {"id": "3-6", "text": "While biobanks are essential for medical research, their  operation is often hindered by infrastructure limitations,  governance issues, and lack of standardization.

Additionally,  many biobanks operate in isolation, leading to fragmenta- tion, reduplication of efforts and limited data sharing. To better understand and address these challenges,  Shickle et\u00a0al. classified biobank networks into six opera- tional categories\u2014\u2018storage\u2019, \u2018bring-and-share\u2019, \u2018catalogue\u2019,  \u2018partnership\u2019, \u2018contribution\u2019, and \u2018expertise\u2019\u2014based on  their operational and governance structures rather than their  research focus. For example, storage networks primarily  offer centralized infrastructure, developed to provide cost- effective shared storage solutions, while expertise networks  focus on knowledge-sharing and standardization rather than  sample exchange. This non-mutually exclusive, governance-  and operational-focused classification provides a framework  for improving biobanking networking and identifying solu- tions from an operational perspective [ 10 ,  11 ]. Cross-departmental collaboration, such as partnerships  with pathology or clinical biochemistry laboratories, has  been shown to improve sample collection accuracy and  overall biobank quality, as exemplified by the Danish Rheu- matologic Biobanks [ 12 ]. However, variability in sample  processing and the absence of harmonized protocols across  different biobanks remain major concerns. Differences in  collection, handling and storage can introduce confounding  factors, potentially compromising the validity of findings  due to uncontrolled preanalytical variables. Additionally,  accurate and standardized clinical data is also vital for link- ing molecular profiles to disease outcomes [ 13 ,  14 ]. To mitigate these challenges, international efforts have  focused on establishing standards for sample collection, stor- age, and distribution. The International Society for Biological  and Environmental Repositories (ISBER) provides compre- hensive guidance through its Best Practices for Repositories,  emphasizing risk and quality management, ethical and social  considerations, and uniform specimen handling [ 15 ]. Similarly, the International Standards Organization (ISO)  has developed ISO 20387:2018, an international standard  specifically for biobanking. This certification sets glob- ally recognized quality and competency requirements for  biorepositories, covering sample collection, preparation,  data management, storage, and distribution [ 16 ]. Institu- tions adhering to this standard demonstrate high-quality  biobanking practices, fostering international collaboration  and improving research reproducibility. These efforts by  ISBER and ISO have been instrumental in synchronizing  biobanking practices globally. The field of oncology also provides a successful model  for standardization, with The National Cancer Institute Best  Practices for Biospecimen Resources serving as a bench- mark for consistent biospecimen handling [ 17 ].", "bbox": {"x0": 306.1435852050781, "y0": 54.14585494995117, "x1": 546.9302368164062, "y1": 719.23583984375}}], [{"id": "4-1", "text": "Curr Rheumatol Rep           (2025) 27:24     24   Page 4 of 19", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 31.765121459960938, "x1": 511.62139892578125, "y1": 41.33612060546875}}, {"id": "4-2", "text": "Establishing and\u00a0Maintaining  Disease\u2011Specific Biobanks in\u00a0Rheumatology:  Logistical Considerations", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 53.97581100463867, "x1": 289.4239807128906, "y1": 93.85186767578125}}, {"id": "4-3", "text": "Biospecimen Collection and\u00a0Handling", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 106.00981140136719, "x1": 221.67648315429688, "y1": 118.59381103515625}}, {"id": "4-4", "text": "The collection and storage of biospecimens for biobank- ing has historically lacked standardized practices, par- ticularly in the pre-analytical steps [ 18 ].

Crit- ics, however, contend that broad consent undermines true  informed consent since donors cannot anticipate all future  uses of their biospecimens [ 40 ]. Hartanti et\u00a0al. developed and piloted a broad informed  consent model in Indonesia consisting of an information  sheet, comprehension test, agreement sheet and exit survey.  When implemented on patients, they found it to be ethi- cally sound, understandable, and acceptable, with recom- mendations for improving readability and staff coordination  [ 41 ]. The COVID-19 pandemic further transformed consent  practices, emphasizing flexibility and recalibrating research  efficacy and participant autonomy [ 43 ].

For example,  the National Patient-Centered Clinical Reasearch Netwotk  (PCORnet) in the United States and the international Obser- vational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)  network illustrate federated governance: each participating  institution keeps custody of its patient data in a standardized  format, and analyses are run locally to aggregate results [ 53 ,  54 ]. Implementing FAIR-compliant data stewardship is chal- lenging, necessitating expertise in domain knowledge,  information technology systems, data access policies,  machine-readable formats, and communication software.  To address these barriers, the rare disease community in  Europe has embraced the\"Bring Your Own Data\"(BYOD)  workshop concept to help rare disease researchers learn how  to make their data FAIR-compliant. Additionally, initiatives  like\"RDs GO FAIR\"and activities of ELIXIR (the European  Infrastructure for life science data), BBMRI (Better Biol- ogy Makes Reality Interesting), NIH (National Institute of  Health), and EURORDIS (European Organization for Rare  Diseases) amongst others are working to establish a FAIR- compliant ecosystem that enables new data analysis possi- bilities in an Open Science environment [ 48 ,  55 ]. Another significant obstacle for researchers involves  locating relevant resources via cataloging services like  the European Research Infrastructure on Biobanking and  Biomolecular Resources (BBMRI-ERIC) Directory. Such  directories, often lack sufficient metadata for researchers to  accurately assess resource suitability. The BBMRI-ERIC  developed the Negotiator tool, which facilitates direct  negotiation of access request amongover 600 participating  biobanks, streamlining requests across multiple resources  while enabling biobanks to manage access decisions inde- pendently [ 56 ].", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02358627319336, "y0": 54.14585494995117, "x1": 291.7936706542969, "y1": 481.73583984375}}, {"id": "8-3", "text": "Ethical, legal and\u00a0societal considerations  in\u00a0biobanking", "bbox": {"x0": 51.02360153198242, "y0": 502.5078430175781, "x1": 269.1092529296875, "y1": 529.8798217773438}}, {"id": "8-4", "text": "The operation and collaboration of biobanks are often com- plicated by ethical, legal and societal challenges, which can  restrict biospecimen and data sharing across jurisdictions,  hinder international research efforts and impact public trust.

Addressing these  concerns through education, engagement and transparent  policy practices is essential to ensure sustainable participa- tion in biobanking efforts. Cross-country collaboration presents additional complex- ities due to differing ethical and legal frameworks, making  it difficult to share biological samples and data across juris- dictions. Key barriers include inconsistent consent require- ments, differing data protection laws and the absence of  globally standardized protocols. The Organization for Eco- nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an inter- governmental organization with 38 member countries, plays  a vital role in shaping the global biobanking landscape by  provided guidance on ethical governance, regulatory frame- works and international collaboration [ 59 ]. The OECD  Guidelines on Human Biobanks and Genetic Research  Databases serves as a reference for ensuring transparency,  protecting donor rights and fostering trust in collaborative  biobank-based research. Innovative data governance models, such as federated  data networks, offer promising solutions for ethical and  secure collaboration by allowing data to remain within  local institutions while permitting controlled, query-based  access across networks. This approach minimizes the need  for physical data transfers, thereby reducing risks to privacy  and respecting local legal frameworks [ 50 ].

Integrating standardized pre-analytical protocols into  biobank management is also essential, especially for new  facilities and high-priority specimens in established reposi- tories. This approach is much needed as biorepositories  face growing demands for quality assurance. Implement- ing SPREC, BRISQ or MIABIS in this context may har- monize the existing systems and align with global efforts  to improve quality management [ 19 ]. Moving forward, col- laboration across biobanking communities will be crucial  ideally through virtual pilot projects that use shared online  platforms and databases to simulate, and refine preanalytical  barcode systems.

national and transnational entities  (e.g., EU, WHO) should prioritize centralized rare disease  registries, emphasizing data curation and sharing. Platforms  like the Rare Disease Cures Accelerator-Data and Analytics  Platform (RDCA-DAP) could offer funding towards data- enabled registries, encouraging standardized biobank link- age [ 103 ]. This approach would dismantle proprietary data  silos, meet stakeholder needs, and de-risk early-stage trials,  thereby incentivizing industry investment in rare disease  research [ 104 ]. Academic institutions should reconsider promotion and  recognition criteria by shifting away from rewarding data  ownership and instead recognizing data-sharing practices  and collective achievements. This shift would encourage  broader participation and promote more efficient resource  utilization across the rare disease research field. Investing in biobanking infrastructure  is another  critical priority. Developing advanced IT systems for data  management, secure storage facilities, and comprehensive  training programs for biobank personnel will ensure the  long-term sustainability and efficiency of biobanking opera- tions [ 105 ]. Innovative technologies, such as permissioned  blockchain frameworks, can enhance transparency and trace- ability in biobanking processes [ 106 ]. Additionally, tools  like text mining can facilitate easier data extraction from  electronic medical records, improving data collection effi- ciency [ 107 ]. While innovative technologies can enhance data extrac- tion efficiency, they may be difficult to be implemented in  resource-restricted environments. In these settings, it is cru- cial to prioritize foundational infrastructure, such as basic  cold chain solutions and essential data management systems,  to ensure at least minimal compliance with biobanking  standards. Focusing on biospecimens that are easier to han- dle, like DNA and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues,  may be more feasible. In contrast, specimens such as RNA,  proteins, or fresh tissues, which are used for metabolomics  and proteomics, require strict handling and cold chain con- trol, making them impractical where processing protocols  are hard to maintain [ 108 ]. A move towards integrative, open, and community- driven registries  is also necessary to overcome the limi- tations of existing systems. Such registries should align  and harmonize conflicting standards, make data and code  publicly available, and engage community members in  governance, thereby promoting sustainability and lon- gevity [ 109 ]. Tailoring biobank operations to the specific types of  samples and assays needed in each context is essential for  maintaining high-quality research outcomes.

Educational initiatives  aimed at young translational sci- entists are vital for accelerating advancements in the field.  Encouraging researchers to think beyond their institutions  and embrace collaborative approaches early in their careers  can foster more innovative and inclusive research efforts  [ 111 ,  112 ].
